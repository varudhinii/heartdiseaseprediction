# Heart Disease Prediction System

## PROBLEM STATEMENT
Early detection of heart disease is critical to reduce mortality rates. This project predicts the likelihood of heart disease using machine learning techniques.

## DESCRIPTION
This project involves developing a machine learning–based Heart Disease Prediction System to support early detection of cardiovascular diseases. Using a dataset of 303 patient records with 13 clinical features such as age, chest pain type, cholesterol levels, and heart rate, the data was preprocessed and scaled for model training. Logistic Regression and Random Forest classifiers were implemented and evaluated using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. Logistic Regression achieved the best performance with an accuracy of approximately 85%.
The trained model was saved and deployed through an interactive Streamlit web application, enabling users to input medical parameters and receive real-time predictions. This project demonstrates an end-to-end AI solution, covering data preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and deployment using Python and Scikit-learn.
